Using Clipping PLanes in SUMA

There may be up to six clipping planes.  They are formed with shift-ctrl-C
No more clipping planes may be added once there are six.

The clipping plane may be viewed, as a rectangle, with shift-C which toggles the
rectangle on and off.

The clipping plane may be moved forward and back with alt-scrollwheel
The clipping plane is rotated, about the y-axis, with alt-(left or right arrow keys),
or about the x-axis with alt-(up or down arrow keys).

The clipping plane is selected with alt-(number of the plane)
The clipping plane is toggled on and off with ctrl-(number of the plane)
