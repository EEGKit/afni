Using Clipping PLanes in SUMA

NB. Use of clipping planes now requires that SUMA is in clipping plane mode.  
By default SUMA is not in clipping plane mode.  
Shift-Ctrl-C toggles in and out of clipping plane mode.

There may be up to six clipping planes.  They are formed with shift-ctrl-C
No more clipping planes may be added once there are six.

The clipping plane may be viewed, as a rectangle, with shift-C which toggles the
rectangle on and off.

The clipping plane may be moved forward and back with alt-scrollwheel
The clipping plane is rotated, about the y-axis, with alt-(left or right arrow keys),
or about the x-axis with alt-(up or down arrow keys).

The clipping plane is selected with alt-(number of the plane)
The clipping plane is toggled on and off with ctrl-(number of the plane)

f reverses the normal of the selected clipping plane.

# [PT: Apr 16, 2021] notes/comments on current clipping plane behavior
# on Ubuntu 20.04.

There can be up to 6 clipping planes, numbered [1-6].  Each has a
separate color, being in order R G B C M Y.  So, plane 1 can be viewed
in Red, plane 4 in Cyan, etc.

Below, "a number" can be in range [1-6].

"active" means a clipping plane is clipping, not just visible.

Key+mouse behavior
------------------

Shift-Ctrl-c      : toggles in and out of clipping plane mode.

n                 : successively add new clipping planes, which are active
                    as they appear (you might not see them to start,
                    just their clipping effect)

[a number]        : toggle the clipping behavior of numbered plane on/off 

alt-[a number]    : select the numbered clipping plane (e.g., so you can 
                    rotate/translate it with other key presses).  If the specified
                    number > # planes, planes are added up to the specified number.

7                 : Toggle all active clipping planes on or off 

0                 : If there are active clipping planes, turns all planes off and                   exits clipping plane mode.  Otherwise, turns all clipping planes on.  On reentering clipping plane mode, turns all clipping planes on. 

ctrl+f            : flip clipping direction of selected plane

Shift+c           : toggle view of all active clipping planes on/off

Alt/Cmd/Opt+[scrollwheel] : translate a clipping plane in space

s                 : Scroll clipping plane inwards

Shift-S            : Scroll clipping plane outwards

Alt/Cmd/Opt+[up-down arrow key]      : rotate clipping plane around x-axis

Alt/Cmd/Opt+[left-right arrow key]   : rotate clipping plane around y-axis
